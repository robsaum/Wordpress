# Reusable Links
This is a WordPress plugin that automatically builds a link using the data in the wp_links table. No need to search and replace links on your site, just update a link in the Links Manager and those links created with this plugin are automatically updated throughout your site.

## Usage
This application looks for text enclosed within two curly braces. Let the system know that you want to replace this text with a link by using the 'url' identifier followed by the name of the link. Use the format {{url:Link Name}}.

## Notes
This plugin enables the Links Manager in WordPress which was deprecated in WordPress 3.5 (http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21307).
